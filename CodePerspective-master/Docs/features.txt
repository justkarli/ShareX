simultaneous monitoring windows

xray dlls and start monitory on demand

openGL renderer that uses no cpu compared to gdi plus renderer

infer the running of not xrayed components

matrix debugger

pan/zoom node graph view
	dont draw elements not in view
	z key to drag outline and zoom on that

class level call graph
	each instance (class) is a node
		functions inside are a mini call graph
		class is the node
		edges are combined function calls in and out of class
	works better for object stacks and tracking instace communication
	also for inspecting object

	are sub-classes combined with parent?

configure decompile/recompile for diff .net platforms

ability to get value of class variables, do real time reflection of running app

global exception handling

track class variables
	in class node view
	show variables as blocks in row at top of class block
	show diff color access lines from function to varaible

	gravitate functions towards class variables
	treat variables like functions being called
	that way they show in the node map

ekg
	take all the columns of the node graph and map to an ekg like line that pulses up and down

key binding to show/hide xray for app

a time line at the bottom of the app
	shows blocks for running code, whitespace for nothing
	diff rows for diff threads
	always moving

showing dependency lineage between 2 specific classes
	good for modularizing a large project
	can take any two classes and see the chain of nodes that links them
	advantage - can visually, and quickly evaluate dependencies
		where to break dependency chain - after evaluating all itermediates
